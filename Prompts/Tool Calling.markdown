#  Tool Calling

## Book Detail View

1. Add a button to trigger a tool call to provide a brief book review
2. Provide a UI element to alert the user when the response is ready and allow them to view the response

## Cleanup

1. Let's move the Generate button to the top so that's it's immediately visible when the user navigates to the detail view
2. The app should scroll to the generated content when the user taps the button to view it.
